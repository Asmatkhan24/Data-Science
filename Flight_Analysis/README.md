# Airline Performance Analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline operations using Power BI to enhance efficiency and decision-making. It involves creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to understand patterns in flight activity, passenger information, and ticket bookings.

## Problem Statement
The airline industry handles complex data dailyâ€”from flight schedules to passenger bookings. This project aims to streamline and visualize this data to:
- Improve operational efficiency
- Monitor flight and passenger activity
- Identify trends in ticket bookings and cancellations

## Datasets Used
1. *Flight_Information*: Includes FlightID, FlightNumber, Airline, Destination, and Status  
2. *Passenger_Information*: Includes PassengerID, FlightID, and SeatNumber  
3. *Ticket_Information*: Includes TicketID, FlightID, and BookingStatus  

## Key Insights & Visuals
- Flight performance breakdown by airline and destination  
- Passenger load analysis across flights  
- Booking status distribution (confirmed, cancelled, etc.)  
- Decomposition Tree to drill down into flight data  

## Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization  
- Power Query for data transformation  

## Outcome
The dashboard provides actionable insights into airline operations, helping stakeholders track performance, spot issues, and make informed decisions in real time.
