# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on features such as electric range, battery capacity, energy consumption, pricing, and manufacturer details. The goal was to derive meaningful insights, perform hypothesis testing, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Grouped analysis by manufacturer and range
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Visualization of trends and comparisons
- Insights and business recommendations

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
Generated insights on which manufacturers provide the best value for range and battery, and identified pricing trends across EV segments.

## Status
Completed
