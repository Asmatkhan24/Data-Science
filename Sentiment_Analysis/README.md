# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Type  
*Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Machine Learning | Text Classification*

## Project Overview  
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. In this project, we analyze movie reviews from the IMDb dataset to predict sentiment based on the review text. Using text preprocessing, feature extraction techniques (such as TF-IDF), and classification algorithms, we develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying the sentiment of movie reviews.

The insights gained from this project can assist movie producers, critics, and platforms like IMDb in understanding public opinion and tailoring their marketing or content strategies accordingly.

## Problem Statement  
The goal is to build a machine learning classification model that can predict whether an IMDb movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. We aim to:
- Clean and preprocess the review text
- Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF
- Train multiple classification algorithms to compare performance
- Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset Information  
The IMDb dataset includes a large collection of movie reviews labeled with their sentiment:
- *Text of the review*: The user's opinion about a movie
- *Sentiment label*: Either "positive" or "negative"

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / spaCy for text preprocessing  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  

## Outcome  
A trained NLP classification model that can predict the sentiment of a movie review, providing valuable insights into public opinion on films.
