# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Type
*Machine Learning | Classification*

## Project Overview
Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to when a customer discontinues their relationship with a company or service provider. In todayâ€™s highly competitive business environment, retaining customers is essential for ensuring long-term success. This project focuses on building a *machine learning classification model* that predicts customer churn using demographic, account, and service usage data.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to:
- Develop a classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.
- Use features such as gender, senior citizen status, tenure, and details about the services used (e.g., internet service, phone service, online security).
- Enable the company to identify high-risk customers and take proactive steps to retain them.
- Help improve customer satisfaction and minimize revenue loss through targeted retention strategies.

## Features Used
- Demographics: Gender, Age, Senior Citizen  
- Tenure and contract information  
- Internet, phone, and streaming service usage  
- Billing preferences and monthly charges  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing  
- Scikit-learn for classification model building  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations  

## Outcome
A trained classification model that effectively predicts churn risk, allowing businesses to intervene early and improve customer retention.
