# News Article Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a text classification model to automatically categorize news articles into predefined categories such as sports, politics, and technology. The goal is to support content management and recommendation systems by automating the classification process using machine learning.

## Problem Statement
In a world where thousands of news articles are generated daily, manual categorization is inefficient. This project aims to develop a robust classifier capable of handling diverse content by:

- Preprocessing and cleaning article text data
- Extracting meaningful features (e.g., TF-IDF)
- Training and evaluating classification models
- Outputting the most probable category for each article

## Key Steps

- *Data Preprocessing*: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization
- *Feature Extraction*: TF-IDF vectorization
- *Model Development*: Trained multiple models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest
- *Evaluation*: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Outcome
The final model classifies news articles accurately into multiple categories, enabling faster content tagging and better user engagement through personalized recommendations.
