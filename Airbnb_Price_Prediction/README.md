# Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights

## Project Type
*Machine Learning | Regression*

## Project Overview
Airbnb allows property owners to rent their spaces to travelers worldwide. Pricing listings correctly is crucial for hosts to stay competitive and maximize their revenue. This project focuses on building a *regression-based machine learning model* to predict the price of Airbnb listings using multiple features such as property type, room type, location, amenities, and host characteristics.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to:
- Develop a machine learning regression model that predicts the price of an Airbnb listing.
- Use features such as property type, room type, number of reviews, location, and amenities to improve price prediction accuracy.
- Extract insights that help Airbnb hosts understand what influences price and enable them to make informed pricing decisions.
- Assist Airbnb in refining pricing recommendations to enhance user satisfaction for both hosts and guests.

## Features Used
- Property Type  
- Room Type  
- Location (City/Neighbourhood)  
- Amenities  
- Host Response Metrics  
- Number of Reviews  
- Availability and Duration  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing  
- Scikit-learn for model development  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization  

## Outcome
A tuned regression model capable of reasonably predicting Airbnb listing prices, along with valuable insights for hosts to optimize pricing strategies.
