# Airbnb Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict Airbnb listing prices based on features like location, property type, room type, amenities, and host activity.

## Project Goals
- Predict listing prices using regression models
- Identify important factors influencing price
- Provide insights for hosts to optimize pricing

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Tuning
- RMSE and R² evaluation
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Outcome
Achieved an RMSE of 0.46 and R² of 0.58 after hyperparameter tuning.

## Files Included
- Airbnb_Price_Prediction.ipynb: Main notebook with code and analysis
- airbnb_data.csv: Dataset used
- visualizations/: Charts showing price distribution and model performance

## Status
Completed
